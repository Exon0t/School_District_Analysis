# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project

Our client Mariam the chief data science for a school city district has asked us to analyses data for students and give an idea of how the budget should be focused. While doing so Mariam has found that the forms have been altered. She is now asking us to update the data after removing grade 9 and comparing the difference between the two.

## Results:
* The distict summary really wanst affected much
*The school Summary on the other hand. Thomas High School went from 888.53 per student to 638.
  *This makes sense of course the number of students going down while budget stayed the sam
*now looking at the socres based on different aspects we can see 
  *That math scores by grades at thomas high school didnt really change. only with 9th being NaN
*There walso also no change in school size or school types which makes me think i made a mistake somewhere.

## Summary
So far this has been the biggest challenge of all the modules. It was hell trying to learn so many different python/pandas scripts. Realizing a lot of things could have been done easier with groupeby". I feel I have made a few mistakes but have also learned from them. If I were to do this again, I would figure out a better way to show my codding cause going through the jumble of data frames was a pain. I look forward to learning more about panda and .loc in the future. Only getting better on my journey
